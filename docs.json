In that scenario, the trust policy of the role being assumed includes a condition that tests for MFA authentication. If the caller does not include valid MFA information, the request to assume the role is denied. The condition in a trust policy that tests for MFA authentication might look like the following example.</p> <p> <code>\"Condition\": {\"Bool\": {\"aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent\": true}}</code> </p> <p>For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/MFAProtectedAPI.html\">Configuring MFA-Protected API Access</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i> guide.</p> <p>To use MFA with <code>AssumeRole</code>, you pass values for the <code>SerialNumber</code> and <code>TokenCode</code> parameters.

Instead, we recommend that you create an IAM user for the purpose of the proxy application. Then attach a policy to the IAM user that limits federated users to only the actions and resources that they need to access. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html\">IAM Best Practices</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>. </p> <p> <b>Session duration</b> </p> <p>The temporary credentials are valid for the specified duration, from 900 seconds (15 minutes) up to a maximum of 129,600 seconds (36 hours). The default session duration is 43,200 seconds (12 hours). Temporary credentials that are obtained by using AWS account root user credentials have a maximum duration of 3,600 seconds (1 hour).</p> <p> <b>Permissions</b> </p> <p>You can use the temporary credentials created by <code>GetFederationToken</code> in any AWS service except the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p>You cannot call any IAM operations using the AWS CLI or the AWS API. </p> </li> <li> <p>You cannot call any STS operations except <code>GetCallerIdentity</code>.</p> </li> </ul> <p>You must pass an inline or managed <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session\">session policy</a> to this operation. You can pass a single JSON policy document to use as an inline session policy. You can also specify up to 10 managed policies to use as managed session policies. The plain text that you use for both inline and managed session policies can't exceed 2,048 characters.</p> <p>Though the session policy parameters are optional, if you do not pass a policy, then the resulting federated user session has no permissions. When you pass session policies, the session permissions are the intersection of the IAM user policies and the session policies that you pass. This gives you a way to further restrict the permissions for a federated user. You cannot use session policies to grant more permissions than those that are defined in the permissions policy of the IAM user. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#policies_session\">Session Policies</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.

If that policy specifically references the federated user session in the <code>Principal</code> element of the policy, the session has the permissions allowed by the policy. These permissions are granted in addition to the permissions granted by the session policies.</p> <p> <b>Tags</b> </p> <p>(Optional) You can pass tag key-value pairs to your session. These are called session tags. For more information about session tags, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_session-tags.html\">Passing Session Tags in STS</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p>An administrator must grant you the permissions necessary to pass session tags. The administrator can also create granular permissions to allow you to pass only specific session tags. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/tutorial_attribute-based-access-control.html\">Tutorial: Using Tags for Attribute-Based Access Control</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p>Tag key–value pairs are not case sensitive, but case is preserved. This means that you cannot have separate <code>Department</code> and <code>department</code> tag keys. Assume that the user that you are federating has the <code>Department</code>=<code>Marketing</code> tag and you pass the <code>department</code>=<code>engineering</code> session tag. <code>Department</code> and <code>department</code> are not saved as separate tags, and the session tag passed in the request takes precedence over the user tag.</p>","STS.GetSessionToken":"<p>Returns a set of temporary credentials for an AWS account or IAM user. The credentials consist of an access key ID, a secret access key, and a security token. Typically, you use <code>GetSessionToken</code> if you want to use MFA to protect programmatic calls to specific AWS API operations like Amazon EC2 <code>StopInstances</code>. MFA-enabled IAM users would need to call <code>GetSessionToken</code> and submit an MFA code that is associated with their MFA device. Using the temporary security credentials that are returned from the call, IAM users can then make programmatic calls to API operations that require MFA authentication. If you do not supply a correct MFA code, then the API returns an access denied error. For a comparison of <code>GetSessionToken</code> with the other API operations that produce temporary credentials, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html\">Requesting Temporary Security Credentials</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#stsapi_comparison\">Comparing the AWS STS API operations</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>.</p> <p> <b>Session Duration</b> </p> <p>The <code>GetSessionToken</code> operation must be called by using the long-term AWS security credentials of the AWS account root user or an IAM user. Credentials that are created by IAM users are valid for the duration that you specify. This duration can range from 900 seconds (15 minutes) up to a maximum of 129,600 seconds (36 hours), with a default of 43,200 seconds (12 hours). Credentials based on account credentials can range from 900 seconds (15 minutes) up to 3,600 seconds (1 hour), with a default of 1 hour. </p> <p> <b>Permissions</b> </p> <p>The temporary security credentials created by <code>GetSessionToken</code> can be used to make API calls to any AWS service with the following exceptions:</p> <ul> <li> <p>You cannot call any IAM API operations unless MFA authentication information is included in the request.</p> </li> <li> <p>You cannot call any STS API <i>except</i> <code>AssumeRole</code> or <code>GetCallerIdentity</code>.</p> </li> </ul> <note> <p>We recommend that you do not call <code>GetSessionToken</code> with AWS account root user credentials. Instead, follow our <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html#create-iam-users\">best practices</a> by creating one or more IAM users, giving them the necessary permissions, and using IAM users for everyday interaction with AWS. </p> </note> <p>The credentials that are returned by <code>GetSessionToken</code> are based on permissions associated with the user whose credentials were used to call the operation. If <code>GetSessionToken</code> is called using AWS account root user credentials, the temporary credentials have root user permissions. Similarly, if <code>GetSessionToken</code> is called using the credentials of an IAM user, the temporary credentials have the same permissions as the IAM user. </p> <p>For more information about using <code>GetSessionToken</code> to create temporary credentials, go to <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_request.html#api_getsessiontoken\">Temporary Credentials for Users in Untrusted Environments</a> in the <i>IAM User Guide</i>. </p>","CognitoIdentity.CreateIdentityPool":"<p>Creates a new identity pool.

A scaling policy applies to the scalable target identified by those three attributes. You cannot create a scaling policy until you have registered the resource as a scalable target.</p> <p>Multiple scaling policies can be in force at the same time for the same scalable target. You can have one or more target tracking scaling policies, one or more step scaling policies, or both. However, there is a chance that multiple policies could conflict, instructing the scalable target to scale out or in at the same time. Application Auto Scaling gives precedence to the policy that provides the largest capacity for both scale out and scale in. For example, if one policy increases capacity by 3, another policy increases capacity by 200 percent, and the current capacity is 10, Application Auto Scaling uses the policy with the highest calculated capacity (200% of 10 = 20) and scales out to 30. </p> <p>We recommend caution, however, when using target tracking scaling policies with step scaling policies because conflicts between these policies can cause undesirable behavior. For example, if the step scaling policy initiates a scale-in activity before the target tracking policy is ready to scale in, the scale-in activity will not be blocked. After the scale-in activity completes, the target tracking policy could instruct the scalable target to scale out again. </p> <p>For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/application/userguide/application-auto-scaling-target-tracking.html\">Target tracking scaling policies</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/application/userguide/application-auto-scaling-step-scaling-policies.html\">Step scaling policies</a> in the <i>Application Auto Scaling User Guide</i>.</p> <note> <p>If a scalable target is deregistered, the scalable target is no longer available to execute scaling policies.

Any parameters that you don't specify are not changed by this update request. The new settings take effect on any scaling activities after this call returns. </p> <p>If you associate a new launch configuration or template with an Auto Scaling group, all new instances will get the updated configuration. Existing instances continue to run with the configuration that they were originally launched with. When you update a group to specify a mixed instances policy instead of a launch configuration or template, existing instances may be replaced to match the new purchasing options that you specified in the policy. For example, if the group currently has 100% On-Demand capacity and the policy specifies 50% Spot capacity, this means that half of your instances will be gradually terminated and relaunched as Spot Instances. When replacing instances, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling launches new instances before terminating the old ones, so that updating your group does not compromise the performance or availability of your application.</p> <p>Note the following about changing <code>DesiredCapacity</code>, <code>MaxSize</code>, or <code>MinSize</code>:</p> <ul> <li> <p>If a scale-in activity occurs as a result of a new <code>DesiredCapacity</code> value that is lower than the current size of the group, the Auto Scaling group uses its termination policy to determine which instances to terminate.</p> </li> <li> <p>If you specify a new value for <code>MinSize</code> without specifying a value for <code>DesiredCapacity</code>, and the new <code>MinSize</code> is larger than the current size of the group, this sets the group's <code>DesiredCapacity</code> to the new <code>MinSize</code> value.</p> </li> <li> <p>If you specify a new value for <code>MaxSize</code> without specifying a value for <code>DesiredCapacity</code>, and the new <code>MaxSize</code> is smaller than the current size of the group, this sets the group's <code>DesiredCapacity</code> to the new <code>MaxSize</code> value.</p> </li> </ul> <p>To see which parameters have been set, call the <a>DescribeAutoScalingGroups</a> API. To view the scaling policies for an Auto Scaling group, call the <a>DescribePolicies</a> API. If the group has scaling policies, you can update them by calling the <a>PutScalingPolicy</a> API.</p>","Batch.CancelJob":"<p>Cancels a job in an AWS Batch job queue. Jobs that are in the <code>SUBMITTED</code>, <code>PENDING</code>, or <code>RUNNABLE</code> state are canceled. Jobs that have progressed to <code>STARTING</code> or <code>RUNNING</code> aren't canceled, but the API operation still succeeds, even if no job is canceled. These jobs must be terminated with the <a>TerminateJob</a> operation.</p>","Batch.CreateComputeEnvironment":"<p>Creates an AWS Batch compute environment. You can create <code>MANAGED</code> or <code>UNMANAGED</code> compute environments. <code>MANAGED</code> compute environments can use Amazon EC2 or AWS Fargate resources. <code>UNMANAGED</code> compute environments can only use EC2 resources.</p> <p>In a managed compute environment, AWS Batch manages the capacity and instance types of the compute resources within the environment. This is based on the compute resource specification that you define or the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-launch-templates.html\">launch template</a> that you specify when you create the compute environment. Either, you can choose to use EC2 On-Demand Instances and EC2 Spot Instances. Or, you can use Fargate and Fargate Spot capacity in your managed compute environment. You can optionally set a maximum price so that Spot Instances only launch when the Spot Instance price is less than a specified percentage of the On-Demand price.</p> <note> <p>Multi-node parallel jobs aren't supported on Spot Instances.</p> </note> <p>In an unmanaged compute environment, you can manage your own EC2 compute resources and have a lot of flexibility with how you configure your compute resources. For example, you can use custom AMIs. However, you must verify that each of your AMIs meet the Amazon ECS container instance AMI specification. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/container_instance_AMIs.html\">container instance AMIs</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide</i>. After you created your unmanaged compute environment, you can use the <a>DescribeComputeEnvironments</a> operation to find the Amazon ECS cluster that's associated with it. Then, launch your container instances into that Amazon ECS cluster. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/launch_container_instance.html\">Launching an Amazon ECS container instance</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide</i>.</p> <note> <p>AWS Batch doesn't upgrade the AMIs in a compute environment after the environment is created. For example, it doesn't update the AMIs when a newer version of the Amazon ECS optimized AMI is available. Therefore, you're responsible for managing the guest operating system (including its updates and security patches) and any additional application software or utilities that you install on the compute resources. To use a new AMI for your AWS Batch jobs, complete these steps:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Create a new compute environment with the new AMI.</p> </li> <li> <p>Add the compute environment to an existing job queue.</p> </li> <li> <p>Remove the earlier compute environment from your job queue.</p> </li> <li> <p>Delete the earlier compute environment.</p> </li> </ol> </note>","Batch.CreateJobQueue":"<p>Creates an AWS Batch job queue. When you create a job queue, you associate one or more compute environments to the queue and assign an order of preference for the compute environments.</p> <p>You also set a priority to the job queue that determines the order that the AWS Batch scheduler places jobs onto its associated compute environments. For example, if a compute environment is associated with more than one job queue, the job queue with a higher priority is given preference for scheduling jobs to that compute environment.</p>","Batch.DeleteComputeEnvironment":"<p>Deletes an AWS Batch compute environment.</p> <p>Before you can delete a compute environment, you must set its state to <code>DISABLED</code> with the <a>UpdateComputeEnvironment</a> API operation and disassociate it from any job queues with the <a>UpdateJobQueue</a> API operation. Compute environments that use AWS Fargate resources must terminate all active jobs on that compute environment before deleting the compute environment. If this isn't done, the compute environment enters an invalid state.</p>","Batch.DeleteJobQueue":"<p>Deletes the specified job queue. You must first disable submissions for a queue with the <a>UpdateJobQueue</a> operation. All jobs in the queue are eventually terminated when you delete a job queue. The jobs are terminated at a rate of about 16 jobs each second.</p> <p>It's not necessary to disassociate compute environments from a queue before submitting a <code>DeleteJobQueue</code> request.</p>","Batch.DeregisterJobDefinition":"<p>Deregisters an AWS Batch job definition.

Backwards-compatible minor version upgrades are instantaneously available for readers on all objects in the directory. Note: This is a synchronous API call and upgrades only one schema on a given directory per call. To upgrade multiple directories from one schema, you would need to call this API on each directory.</p>","CloudDirectory.UpgradePublishedSchema":"<p>Upgrades a published schema under a new minor version revision using the current contents of <code>DevelopmentSchemaArn</code>.</p>","CloudFormation.CancelUpdateStack":"<p>Cancels an update on the specified stack. If the call completes successfully, the stack rolls back the update and reverts to the previous stack configuration.</p> <note> <p>You can cancel only stacks that are in the UPDATE_IN_PROGRESS state.</p> </note>","CloudFormation.ContinueUpdateRollback":"<p>For a specified stack that is in the <code>UPDATE_ROLLBACK_FAILED</code> state, continues rolling it back to the <code>UPDATE_ROLLBACK_COMPLETE</code> state. Depending on the cause of the failure, you can manually <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/troubleshooting.html#troubleshooting-errors-update-rollback-failed\"> fix the error</a> and continue the rollback. By continuing the rollback, you can return your stack to a working state (the <code>UPDATE_ROLLBACK_COMPLETE</code> state), and then try to update the stack again.</p> <p>A stack goes into the <code>UPDATE_ROLLBACK_FAILED</code> state when AWS CloudFormation cannot roll back all changes after a failed stack update. For example, you might have a stack that is rolling back to an old database instance that was deleted outside of AWS CloudFormation. Because AWS CloudFormation doesn't know the database was deleted, it assumes that the database instance still exists and attempts to roll back to it, causing the update rollback to fail.</p>","CloudFormation.CreateChangeSet":"<p>Creates a list of changes that will be applied to a stack so that you can review the changes before executing them. You can create a change set for a stack that doesn't exist or an existing stack. If you create a change set for a stack that doesn't exist, the change set shows all of the resources that AWS CloudFormation will create. If you create a change set for an existing stack, AWS CloudFormation compares the stack's information with the information that you submit in the change set and lists the differences. Use change sets to understand which resources AWS CloudFormation will create or change, and how it will change resources in an existing stack, before you create or update a stack.</p> <p>To create a change set for a stack that doesn't exist, for the <code>ChangeSetType</code> parameter, specify <code>CREATE</code>. To create a change set for an existing stack, specify <code>UPDATE</code> for the <code>ChangeSetType</code> parameter. To create a change set for an import operation, specify <code>IMPORT</code> for the <code>ChangeSetType</code> parameter. After the <code>CreateChangeSet</code> call successfully completes, AWS CloudFormation starts creating the change set. To check the status of the change set or to review it, use the <a>DescribeChangeSet</a> action.</p> <p>When you are satisfied with the changes the change set will make, execute the change set by using the <a>ExecuteChangeSet</a> action. AWS CloudFormation doesn't make changes until you execute the change set.</p> <p>To create a change set for the entire stack hierachy, set <code>IncludeNestedStacks</code> to <code>True</code>.</p>","CloudFormation.CreateStack":"<p>Creates a stack as specified in the template. After the call completes successfully, the stack creation starts. You can check the status of the stack via the <a>DescribeStacks</a> API.</p>","CloudFormation.CreateStackInstances":"<p>Creates stack instances for the specified accounts, within the specified Regions. A stack instance refers to a stack in a specific account and Region.

Deprecated extensions or extension versions cannot be used in CloudFormation operations.</p> <p>To deregister an entire extension, you must individually deregister all active versions of that extension. If an extension has only a single active version, deregistering that version results in the extension itself being deregistered and marked as deprecated in the registry. </p> <p>You cannot deregister the default version of an extension if there are other active version of that extension.

Data points are not returned in chronological order.</p> <p>CloudWatch aggregates data points based on the length of the period that you specify. For example, if you request statistics with a one-hour period, CloudWatch aggregates all data points with time stamps that fall within each one-hour period. Therefore, the number of values aggregated by CloudWatch is larger than the number of data points returned.</p> <p>CloudWatch needs raw data points to calculate percentile statistics.

However, EventBridge uses an exact match in event patterns and rules. Be sure to use the correct ARN characters when creating event patterns so that they match the ARN syntax in the event you want to match.</p> <p>In EventBridge, it is possible to create rules that lead to infinite loops, where a rule is fired repeatedly. For example, a rule might detect that ACLs have changed on an S3 bucket, and trigger software to change them to the desired state. If the rule is not written carefully, the subsequent change to the ACLs fires the rule again, creating an infinite loop.</p> <p>To prevent this, write the rules so that the triggered actions do not re-fire the same rule. For example, your rule could fire only if ACLs are found to be in a bad state, instead of after any change. </p> <p>An infinite loop can quickly cause higher than expected charges. We recommend that you use budgeting, which alerts you when charges exceed your specified limit.

However, snapshots only capture data that has been written to your EBS volume at the time the snapshot command is issued; this might exclude any data that has been cached by any applications or the operating system. If you can pause any file systems on the volume long enough to take a snapshot, your snapshot should be complete. However, if you cannot pause all file writes to the volume, you should unmount the volume from within the instance, issue the snapshot command, and then remount the volume to ensure a consistent and complete snapshot. You may remount and use your volume while the snapshot status is <code>pending</code>.</p> <p>To create a snapshot for EBS volumes that serve as root devices, you should stop the instance before taking the snapshot.</p> <p>Snapshots that are taken from encrypted volumes are automatically encrypted.

Volume status provides the result of the checks performed on your volumes to determine events that can impair the performance of your volumes. The performance of a volume can be affected if an issue occurs on the volume's underlying host. If the volume's underlying host experiences a power outage or system issue, after the system is restored, there could be data inconsistencies on the volume. Volume events notify you if this occurs.

For example, if your volume returns an <code>impaired</code> status, then the volume event might be <code>potential-data-inconsistency</code>. This means that your volume has been affected by an issue with the underlying host, has all I/O operations disabled, and might have inconsistent data.</p> <p> <i>Actions</i>: Reflect the actions you might have to take in response to an event. For example, if the status of the volume is <code>impaired</code> and the volume event shows <code>potential-data-inconsistency</code>, then the action shows <code>enable-volume-io</code>. This means that you may want to enable the I/O operations for the volume by calling the <a>EnableVolumeIO</a> action and then check the volume for data consistency.</p> <p>Volume status is based on the volume status checks, and does not reflect the volume state.

However, your root partition Amazon EBS volume remains and continues to persist your data, and you are charged for Amazon EBS volume usage. You can restart your instance at any time. Every time you start your Windows instance, Amazon EC2 charges you for a full instance hour. If you stop and restart your Windows instance, a new instance hour begins and Amazon EC2 charges you for another full instance hour even if you are still within the same 60-minute period when it was stopped. Every time you start your Linux instance, Amazon EC2 charges a one-minute minimum for instance usage, and thereafter charges per second for instance usage.</p> <p>Before stopping an instance, make sure it is in a state from which it can be restarted.

If the number of tasks running in a service drops below the <code>desiredCount</code>, Amazon ECS runs another copy of the task in the specified cluster. To update an existing service, see the UpdateService action.</p> <p>In addition to maintaining the desired count of tasks in your service, you can optionally run your service behind one or more load balancers. The load balancers distribute traffic across the tasks that are associated with the service. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/service-load-balancing.html\">Service Load Balancing</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide</i>.</p> <p>Tasks for services that <i>do not</i> use a load balancer are considered healthy if they're in the <code>RUNNING</code> state. Tasks for services that <i>do</i> use a load balancer are considered healthy if they're in the <code>RUNNING</code> state and the container instance that they're hosted on is reported as healthy by the load balancer.</p> <p>There are two service scheduler strategies available:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>REPLICA</code> - The replica scheduling strategy places and maintains the desired number of tasks across your cluster. By default, the service scheduler spreads tasks across Availability Zones. You can use task placement strategies and constraints to customize task placement decisions.

The service scheduler also evaluates the task placement constraints for running tasks and will stop tasks that do not meet the placement constraints. When using this strategy, you don't need to specify a desired number of tasks, a task placement strategy, or use Service Auto Scaling policies. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs_services.html\">Service Scheduler Concepts</a> in the <i>Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide</i>.</p> </li> </ul> <p>You can optionally specify a deployment configuration for your service. The deployment is triggered by changing properties, such as the task definition or the desired count of a service, with an <a>UpdateService</a> operation. The default value for a replica service for <code>minimumHealthyPercent</code> is 100%. The default value for a daemon service for <code>minimumHealthyPercent</code> is 0%.</p> <p>If a service is using the <code>ECS</code> deployment controller, the minimum healthy percent represents a lower limit on the number of tasks in a service that must remain in the <code>RUNNING</code> state during a deployment, as a percentage of the desired number of tasks (rounded up to the nearest integer), and while any container instances are in the <code>DRAINING</code> state if the service contains tasks using the EC2 launch type. This parameter enables you to deploy without using additional cluster capacity. For example, if your service has a desired number of four tasks and a minimum healthy percent of 50%, the scheduler might stop two existing tasks to free up cluster capacity before starting two new tasks. Tasks for services that <i>do not</i> use a load balancer are considered healthy if they're in the <code>RUNNING</code> state. Tasks for services that <i>do</i> use a load balancer are considered healthy if they're in the <code>RUNNING</code> state and they're reported as healthy by the load balancer. The default value for minimum healthy percent is 100%.</p> <p>If a service is using the <code>ECS</code> deployment controller, the <b>maximum percent</b> parameter represents an upper limit on the number of tasks in a service that are allowed in the <code>RUNNING</code> or <code>PENDING</code> state during a deployment, as a percentage of the desired number of tasks (rounded down to the nearest integer), and while any container instances are in the <code>DRAINING</code> state if the service contains tasks using the EC2 launch type. This parameter enables you to define the deployment batch size. For example, if your service has a desired number of four tasks and a maximum percent value of 200%, the scheduler may start four new tasks before stopping the four older tasks (provided that the cluster resources required to do this are available). The default value for maximum percent is 200%.</p> <p>If a service is using either the <code>CODE_DEPLOY</code> or <code>EXTERNAL</code> deployment controller types and tasks that use the EC2 launch type, the <b>minimum healthy percent</b> and <b>maximum percent</b> values are used only to define the lower and upper limit on the number of the tasks in the service that remain in the <code>RUNNING</code> state while the container instances are in the <code>DRAINING</code> state. If the tasks in the service use the Fargate launch type, the minimum healthy percent and maximum percent values aren't used, although they're currently visible when describing your service.</p> <p>When creating a service that uses the <code>EXTERNAL</code> deployment controller, you can specify only parameters that aren't controlled at the task set level. The only required parameter is the service name. You control your services using the <a>CreateTaskSet</a> operation.

The configuration can range from 90 shards and 0 replicas to 15 shards and 5 replicas, which is the maximum number or replicas allowed. </p> <p>The node or shard limit can be increased to a maximum of 500 per cluster if the Redis engine version is 5.0.6 or higher. For example, you can choose to configure a 500 node cluster that ranges between 83 shards (one primary and 5 replicas per shard) and 500 shards (single primary and no replicas). Make sure there are enough available IP addresses to accommodate the increase. Common pitfalls include the subnets in the subnet group have too small a CIDR range or the subnets are shared and heavily used by other clusters. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/red-ug/SubnetGroups.Creating.html\">Creating a Subnet Group</a>. For versions below 5.0.6, the limit is 250 per cluster.</p> <p>To request a limit increase, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_service_limits.html\">AWS Service Limits</a> and choose the limit type <b>Nodes per cluster per instance type</b>. </p> <p>When a Redis (cluster mode disabled) replication group has been successfully created, you can add one or more read replicas to it, up to a total of 5 read replicas. If you need to increase or decrease the number of node groups (console: shards), you can avail yourself of ElastiCache for Redis' scaling.

The initial status of the delivery stream is <code>CREATING</code>. After the delivery stream is created, its status is <code>ACTIVE</code> and it now accepts data. If the delivery stream creation fails, the status transitions to <code>CREATING_FAILED</code>. Attempts to send data to a delivery stream that is not in the <code>ACTIVE</code> state cause an exception. To check the state of a delivery stream, use <a>DescribeDeliveryStream</a>.</p> <p>If the status of a delivery stream is <code>CREATING_FAILED</code>, this status doesn't change, and you can't invoke <code>CreateDeliveryStream</code> again on it. However, you can invoke the <a>DeleteDeliveryStream</a> operation to delete it.</p> <p>A Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream can be configured to receive records directly from providers using <a>PutRecord</a> or <a>PutRecordBatch</a>, or it can be configured to use an existing Kinesis stream as its source. To specify a Kinesis data stream as input, set the <code>DeliveryStreamType</code> parameter to <code>KinesisStreamAsSource</code>, and provide the Kinesis stream Amazon Resource Name (ARN) and role ARN in the <code>KinesisStreamSourceConfiguration</code> parameter.</p> <p>To create a delivery stream with server-side encryption (SSE) enabled, include <a>DeliveryStreamEncryptionConfigurationInput</a> in your request. This is optional. You can also invoke <a>StartDeliveryStreamEncryption</a> to turn on SSE for an existing delivery stream that doesn't have SSE enabled.</p> <p>A delivery stream is configured with a single destination: Amazon S3, Amazon ES, Amazon Redshift, or Splunk. You must specify only one of the following destination configuration parameters: <code>ExtendedS3DestinationConfiguration</code>, <code>S3DestinationConfiguration</code>, <code>ElasticsearchDestinationConfiguration</code>, <code>RedshiftDestinationConfiguration</code>, or <code>SplunkDestinationConfiguration</code>.</p> <p>When you specify <code>S3DestinationConfiguration</code>, you can also provide the following optional values: BufferingHints, <code>EncryptionConfiguration</code>, and <code>CompressionFormat</code>. By default, if no <code>BufferingHints</code> value is provided, Kinesis Data Firehose buffers data up to 5 MB or for 5 minutes, whichever condition is satisfied first. <code>BufferingHints</code> is a hint, so there are some cases where the service cannot adhere to these conditions strictly. For example, record boundaries might be such that the size is a little over or under the configured buffering size. By default, no encryption is performed. We strongly recommend that you enable encryption to ensure secure data storage in Amazon S3.</p> <p>A few notes about Amazon Redshift as a destination:</p> <ul> <li> <p>An Amazon Redshift destination requires an S3 bucket as intermediate location. Kinesis Data Firehose first delivers data to Amazon S3 and then uses <code>COPY</code> syntax to load data into an Amazon Redshift table. This is specified in the <code>RedshiftDestinationConfiguration.S3Configuration</code> parameter.</p> </li> <li> <p>The compression formats <code>SNAPPY</code> or <code>ZIP</code> cannot be specified in <code>RedshiftDestinationConfiguration.S3Configuration</code> because the Amazon Redshift <code>COPY</code> operation that reads from the S3 bucket doesn't support these compression formats.</p> </li> <li> <p>We strongly recommend that you use the user name and password you provide exclusively with Kinesis Data Firehose, and that the permissions for the account are restricted for Amazon Redshift <code>INSERT</code> permissions.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Kinesis Data Firehose assumes the IAM role that is configured as part of the destination. The role should allow the Kinesis Data Firehose principal to assume the role, and the role should have permissions that allow the service to deliver the data. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/firehose/latest/dev/controlling-access.html#using-iam-s3\">Grant Kinesis Data Firehose Access to an Amazon S3 Destination</a> in the <i>Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose Developer Guide</i>.</p>","Firehose.DeleteDeliveryStream":"<p>Deletes a delivery stream and its data.</p> <p>To check the state of a delivery stream, use <a>DescribeDeliveryStream</a>. You can delete a delivery stream only if it is in one of the following states: <code>ACTIVE</code>, <code>DELETING</code>, <code>CREATING_FAILED</code>, or <code>DELETING_FAILED</code>. You can't delete a delivery stream that is in the <code>CREATING</code> state. While the deletion request is in process, the delivery stream is in the <code>DELETING</code> state.</p> <p>While the delivery stream is in the <code>DELETING</code> state, the service might continue to accept records, but it doesn't make any guarantees with respect to delivering the data. Therefore, as a best practice, first stop any applications that are sending records before you delete a delivery stream.</p>","Firehose.DescribeDeliveryStream":"<p>Describes the specified delivery stream and its status.

Scaling policies are used to automatically scale a fleet's hosting capacity to meet player demand. An active scaling policy instructs Amazon GameLift to track a fleet metric and automatically change the fleet's capacity when a certain threshold is reached. There are two types of scaling policies: target-based and rule-based. Use a target-based policy to quickly and efficiently manage fleet scaling; this option is the most commonly used. Use rule-based policies when you need to exert fine-grained control over auto-scaling. </p> <p>Fleets can have multiple scaling policies of each type in force at the same time; you can have one target-based policy, one or multiple rule-based scaling policies, or both. We recommend caution, however, because multiple auto-scaling policies can have unintended consequences.</p> <p>You can temporarily suspend all scaling policies for a fleet by calling <a>StopFleetActions</a> with the fleet action AUTO_SCALING. To resume scaling policies, call <a>StartFleetActions</a> with the same fleet action. To stop just one scaling policy--or to permanently remove it, you must delete the policy with <a>DeleteScalingPolicy</a>.</p> <p>Learn more about how to work with auto-scaling in <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/fleets-autoscaling.html\">Set Up Fleet Automatic Scaling</a>.</p> <p> <b>Target-based policy</b> </p> <p>A target-based policy tracks a single metric: PercentAvailableGameSessions. This metric tells us how much of a fleet's hosting capacity is ready to host game sessions but is not currently in use. This is the fleet's buffer; it measures the additional player demand that the fleet could handle at current capacity. With a target-based policy, you set your ideal buffer size and leave it to Amazon GameLift to take whatever action is needed to maintain that target. </p> <p>For example, you might choose to maintain a 10% buffer for a fleet that has the capacity to host 100 simultaneous game sessions. This policy tells Amazon GameLift to take action whenever the fleet's available capacity falls below or rises above 10 game sessions. Amazon GameLift will start new instances or stop unused instances in order to return to the 10% buffer. </p> <p>To create or update a target-based policy, specify a fleet ID and name, and set the policy type to \"TargetBased\". Specify the metric to track (PercentAvailableGameSessions) and reference a <a>TargetConfiguration</a> object with your desired buffer value. Exclude all other parameters. On a successful request, the policy name is returned. The scaling policy is automatically in force as soon as it's successfully created. If the fleet's auto-scaling actions are temporarily suspended, the new policy will be in force once the fleet actions are restarted.</p> <p> <b>Rule-based policy</b> </p> <p>A rule-based policy tracks specified fleet metric, sets a threshold value, and specifies the type of action to initiate when triggered. With a rule-based policy, you can select from several available fleet metrics. Each policy specifies whether to scale up or scale down (and by how much), so you need one policy for each type of action. </p> <p>For example, a policy may make the following statement: \"If the percentage of idle instances is greater than 20% for more than 15 minutes, then reduce the fleet capacity by 10%.\"</p> <p>A policy's rule statement has the following structure:</p> <p>If <code>[MetricName]</code> is <code>[ComparisonOperator]</code> <code>[Threshold]</code> for <code>[EvaluationPeriods]</code> minutes, then <code>[ScalingAdjustmentType]</code> to/by <code>[ScalingAdjustment]</code>.</p> <p>To implement the example, the rule statement would look like this:</p> <p>If <code>[PercentIdleInstances]</code> is <code>[GreaterThanThreshold]</code> <code>[20]</code> for <code>[15]</code> minutes, then <code>[PercentChangeInCapacity]</code> to/by <code>[10]</code>.</p> <p>To create or update a scaling policy, specify a unique combination of name and fleet ID, and set the policy type to \"RuleBased\". Specify the parameter values for a policy rule statement. On a successful request, the policy name is returned. Scaling policies are automatically in force as soon as they're successfully created. If the fleet's auto-scaling actions are temporarily suspended, the new policy will be in force once the fleet actions are restarted.</p> <p> <b>Related actions</b> </p> <p> <a>DescribeFleetCapacity</a> | <a>UpdateFleetCapacity</a> | <a>DescribeEC2InstanceLimits</a> | <a>PutScalingPolicy</a> | <a>DescribeScalingPolicies</a> | <a>DeleteScalingPolicy</a> | <a>StopFleetActions</a> | <a>StartFleetActions</a> | <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/latest/developerguide/reference-awssdk.html#reference-awssdk-resources-fleets\">All APIs by task</a> </p>","GameLift.RegisterGameServer":"<p> <b>This operation is used with the GameLift FleetIQ solution and game server groups.</b> </p> <p>Creates a new game server resource and notifies GameLift FleetIQ that the game server is ready to host gameplay and players.

The shard iterator specifies the position in the shard from which you want to start reading data records sequentially. If there are no records available in the portion of the shard that the iterator points to, <a>GetRecords</a> returns an empty list. It might take multiple calls to get to a portion of the shard that contains records.</p> <p>You can scale by provisioning multiple shards per stream while considering service limits (for more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/service-sizes-and-limits.html\">Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Limits</a> in the <i>Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide</i>). Your application should have one thread per shard, each reading continuously from its stream. To read from a stream continually, call <a>GetRecords</a> in a loop. Use <a>GetShardIterator</a> to get the shard iterator to specify in the first <a>GetRecords</a> call. <a>GetRecords</a> returns a new shard iterator in <code>NextShardIterator</code>. Specify the shard iterator returned in <code>NextShardIterator</code> in subsequent calls to <a>GetRecords</a>. If the shard has been closed, the shard iterator can't return more data and <a>GetRecords</a> returns <code>null</code> in <code>NextShardIterator</code>. You can terminate the loop when the shard is closed, or when the shard iterator reaches the record with the sequence number or other attribute that marks it as the last record to process.</p> <p>Each data record can be up to 1 MiB in size, and each shard can read up to 2 MiB per second. You can ensure that your calls don't exceed the maximum supported size or throughput by using the <code>Limit</code> parameter to specify the maximum number of records that <a>GetRecords</a> can return. Consider your average record size when determining this limit. The maximum number of records that can be returned per call is 10,000.</p> <p>The size of the data returned by <a>GetRecords</a> varies depending on the utilization of the shard. The maximum size of data that <a>GetRecords</a> can return is 10 MiB. If a call returns this amount of data, subsequent calls made within the next 5 seconds throw <code>ProvisionedThroughputExceededException</code>. If there is insufficient provisioned throughput on the stream, subsequent calls made within the next 1 second throw <code>ProvisionedThroughputExceededException</code>. <a>GetRecords</a> doesn't return any data when it throws an exception. For this reason, we recommend that you wait 1 second between calls to <a>GetRecords</a>. However, it's possible that the application will get exceptions for longer than 1 second.</p> <p>To detect whether the application is falling behind in processing, you can use the <code>MillisBehindLatest</code> response attribute. You can also monitor the stream using CloudWatch metrics and other mechanisms (see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/monitoring.html\">Monitoring</a> in the <i>Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide</i>).</p> <p>Each Amazon Kinesis record includes a value, <code>ApproximateArrivalTimestamp</code>, that is set when a stream successfully receives and stores a record. This is commonly referred to as a server-side time stamp, whereas a client-side time stamp is set when a data producer creates or sends the record to a stream (a data producer is any data source putting data records into a stream, for example with <a>PutRecords</a>). The time stamp has millisecond precision. There are no guarantees about the time stamp accuracy, or that the time stamp is always increasing. For example, records in a shard or across a stream might have time stamps that are out of order.</p> <p>This operation has a limit of five transactions per second per shard.</p>","Kinesis.GetShardIterator":"<p>Gets an Amazon Kinesis shard iterator. A shard iterator expires 5 minutes after it is returned to the requester.</p> <p>A shard iterator specifies the shard position from which to start reading data records sequentially. The position is specified using the sequence number of a data record in a shard. A sequence number is the identifier associated with every record ingested in the stream, and is assigned when a record is put into the stream. Each stream has one or more shards.</p> <p>You must specify the shard iterator type. For example, you can set the <code>ShardIteratorType</code> parameter to read exactly from the position denoted by a specific sequence number by using the <code>AT_SEQUENCE_NUMBER</code> shard iterator type. Alternatively, the parameter can read right after the sequence number by using the <code>AFTER_SEQUENCE_NUMBER</code> shard iterator type, using sequence numbers returned by earlier calls to <a>PutRecord</a>, <a>PutRecords</a>, <a>GetRecords</a>, or <a>DescribeStream</a>. In the request, you can specify the shard iterator type <code>AT_TIMESTAMP</code> to read records from an arbitrary point in time, <code>TRIM_HORIZON</code> to cause <code>ShardIterator</code> to point to the last untrimmed record in the shard in the system (the oldest data record in the shard), or <code>LATEST</code> so that you always read the most recent data in the shard. </p> <p>When you read repeatedly from a stream, use a <a>GetShardIterator</a> request to get the first shard iterator for use in your first <a>GetRecords</a> request and for subsequent reads use the shard iterator returned by the <a>GetRecords</a> request in <code>NextShardIterator</code>. A new shard iterator is returned by every <a>GetRecords</a> request in <code>NextShardIterator</code>, which you use in the <code>ShardIterator</code> parameter of the next <a>GetRecords</a> request. </p> <p>If a <a>GetShardIterator</a> request is made too often, you receive a <code>ProvisionedThroughputExceededException</code>. For more information about throughput limits, see <a>GetRecords</a>, and <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/service-sizes-and-limits.html\">Streams Limits</a> in the <i>Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide</i>.</p> <p>If the shard is closed, <a>GetShardIterator</a> returns a valid iterator for the last sequence number of the shard. A shard can be closed as a result of using <a>SplitShard</a> or <a>MergeShards</a>.</p> <p> <a>GetShardIterator</a> has a limit of five transactions per second per account per open shard.</p>","Kinesis.IncreaseStreamRetentionPeriod":"<p>Increases the Kinesis data stream's retention period, which is the length of time data records are accessible after they are added to the stream. The maximum value of a stream's retention period is 168 hours (7 days).</p> <p>If you choose a longer stream retention period, this operation increases the time period during which records that have not yet expired are accessible. However, it does not make previous, expired data (older than the stream's previous retention period) accessible after the operation has been called. For example, if a stream's retention period is set to 24 hours and is increased to 168 hours, any data that is older than 24 hours remains inaccessible to consumer applications.</p>","Kinesis.ListShards":"<p>Lists the shards in a stream and provides information about each shard. This operation has a limit of 100 transactions per second per data stream.</p> <important> <p>This API is a new operation that is used by the Amazon Kinesis Client Library (KCL). If you have a fine-grained IAM policy that only allows specific operations, you must update your policy to allow calls to this API. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/streams/latest/dev/controlling-access.html\">Controlling Access to Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Resources Using IAM</a>.</p> </important>","Kinesis.ListStreamConsumers":"<p>Lists the consumers registered to receive data from a stream using enhanced fan-out, and provides information about each consumer.</p> <p>This operation has a limit of 5 transactions per second per stream.</p>","Kinesis.ListStreams":"<p>Lists your Kinesis data streams.</p> <p>The number of streams may be too large to return from a single call to <code>ListStreams</code>. You can limit the number of returned streams using the <code>Limit</code> parameter. If you do not specify a value for the <code>Limit</code> parameter, Kinesis Data Streams uses the default limit, which is currently 10.</p> <p>You can detect if there are more streams available to list by using the <code>HasMoreStreams</code> flag from the returned output. If there are more streams available, you can request more streams by using the name of the last stream returned by the <code>ListStreams</code> request in the <code>ExclusiveStartStreamName</code> parameter in a subsequent request to <code>ListStreams</code>. The group of stream names returned by the subsequent request is then added to the list. You can continue this process until all the stream names have been collected in the list. </p> <p> <a>ListStreams</a> has a limit of five transactions per second per account.</p>","Kinesis.ListTagsForStream":"<p>Lists the tags for the specified Kinesis data stream. This operation has a limit of five transactions per second per account.</p>","Kinesis.MergeShards":"<p>Merges two adjacent shards in a Kinesis data stream and combines them into a single shard to reduce the stream's capacity to ingest and transport data. Two shards are considered adjacent if the union of the hash key ranges for the two shards form a contiguous set with no gaps. For example, if you have two shards, one with a hash key range of 276...381 and the other with a hash key range of 382...454, then you could merge these two shards into a single shard that would have a hash key range of 276...454. After the merge, the single child shard receives data for all hash key values covered by the two parent shards.</p> <p> <code>MergeShards</code> is called when there is a need to reduce the overall capacity of a stream because of excess capacity that is not being used. You must specify the shard to be merged and the adjacent shard for a stream. For more information about merging shards, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/kinesis-using-sdk-java-resharding-merge.html\">Merge Two Shards</a> in the <i>Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide</i>.</p> <p>If the stream is in the <code>ACTIVE</code> state, you can call <code>MergeShards</code>. If a stream is in the <code>CREATING</code>, <code>UPDATING</code>, or <code>DELETING</code> state, <code>MergeShards</code> returns a <code>ResourceInUseException</code>. If the specified stream does not exist, <code>MergeShards</code> returns a <code>ResourceNotFoundException</code>. </p> <p>You can use <a>DescribeStream</a> to check the state of the stream, which is returned in <code>StreamStatus</code>.</p> <p> <code>MergeShards</code> is an asynchronous operation. Upon receiving a <code>MergeShards</code> request, Amazon Kinesis Data Streams immediately returns a response and sets the <code>StreamStatus</code> to <code>UPDATING</code>. After the operation is completed, Kinesis Data Streams sets the <code>StreamStatus</code> to <code>ACTIVE</code>. Read and write operations continue to work while the stream is in the <code>UPDATING</code> state. </p> <p>You use <a>DescribeStream</a> to determine the shard IDs that are specified in the <code>MergeShards</code> request. </p> <p>If you try to operate on too many streams in parallel using <a>CreateStream</a>, <a>DeleteStream</a>, <code>MergeShards</code>, or <a>SplitShard</a>, you receive a <code>LimitExceededException</code>. </p> <p> <code>MergeShards</code> has a limit of five transactions per second per account.</p>","Kinesis.PutRecord":"<p>Writes a single data record into an Amazon Kinesis data stream. Call <code>PutRecord</code> to send data into the stream for real-time ingestion and subsequent processing, one record at a time. Each shard can support writes up to 1,000 records per second, up to a maximum data write total of 1 MiB per second.</p> <p>You must specify the name of the stream that captures, stores, and transports the data; a partition key; and the data blob itself.</p> <p>The data blob can be any type of data; for example, a segment from a log file, geographic/location data, website clickstream data, and so on.</p> <p>The partition key is used by Kinesis Data Streams to distribute data across shards. Kinesis Data Streams segregates the data records that belong to a stream into multiple shards, using the partition key associated with each data record to determine the shard to which a given data record belongs.</p> <p>Partition keys are Unicode strings, with a maximum length limit of 256 characters for each key. An MD5 hash function is used to map partition keys to 128-bit integer values and to map associated data records to shards using the hash key ranges of the shards. You can override hashing the partition key to determine the shard by explicitly specifying a hash value using the <code>ExplicitHashKey</code> parameter. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/developing-producers-with-sdk.html#kinesis-using-sdk-java-add-data-to-stream\">Adding Data to a Stream</a> in the <i>Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide</i>.</p> <p> <code>PutRecord</code> returns the shard ID of where the data record was placed and the sequence number that was assigned to the data record.</p> <p>Sequence numbers increase over time and are specific to a shard within a stream, not across all shards within a stream. To guarantee strictly increasing ordering, write serially to a shard and use the <code>SequenceNumberForOrdering</code> parameter. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/developing-producers-with-sdk.html#kinesis-using-sdk-java-add-data-to-stream\">Adding Data to a Stream</a> in the <i>Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide</i>.</p> <important> <p>After you write a record to a stream, you cannot modify that record or its order within the stream.</p> </important> <p>If a <code>PutRecord</code> request cannot be processed because of insufficient provisioned throughput on the shard involved in the request, <code>PutRecord</code> throws <code>ProvisionedThroughputExceededException</code>. </p> <p>By default, data records are accessible for 24 hours from the time that they are added to a stream. You can use <a>IncreaseStreamRetentionPeriod</a> or <a>DecreaseStreamRetentionPeriod</a> to modify this retention period.</p>","Kinesis.PutRecords":"<p>Writes multiple data records into a Kinesis data stream in a single call (also referred to as a <code>PutRecords</code> request). Use this operation to send data into the stream for data ingestion and processing. </p> <p>Each <code>PutRecords</code> request can support up to 500 records. Each record in the request can be as large as 1 MiB, up to a limit of 5 MiB for the entire request, including partition keys. Each shard can support writes up to 1,000 records per second, up to a maximum data write total of 1 MiB per second.</p> <p>You must specify the name of the stream that captures, stores, and transports the data; and an array of request <code>Records</code>, with each record in the array requiring a partition key and data blob. The record size limit applies to the total size of the partition key and data blob.</p> <p>The data blob can be any type of data; for example, a segment from a log file, geographic/location data, website clickstream data, and so on.</p> <p>The partition key is used by Kinesis Data Streams as input to a hash function that maps the partition key and associated data to a specific shard. An MD5 hash function is used to map partition keys to 128-bit integer values and to map associated data records to shards. As a result of this hashing mechanism, all data records with the same partition key map to the same shard within the stream. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/developing-producers-with-sdk.html#kinesis-using-sdk-java-add-data-to-stream\">Adding Data to a Stream</a> in the <i>Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide</i>.</p> <p>Each record in the <code>Records</code> array may include an optional parameter, <code>ExplicitHashKey</code>, which overrides the partition key to shard mapping. This parameter allows a data producer to determine explicitly the shard where the record is stored. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/developing-producers-with-sdk.html#kinesis-using-sdk-java-putrecords\">Adding Multiple Records with PutRecords</a> in the <i>Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide</i>.</p> <p>The <code>PutRecords</code> response includes an array of response <code>Records</code>. Each record in the response array directly correlates with a record in the request array using natural ordering, from the top to the bottom of the request and response. The response <code>Records</code> array always includes the same number of records as the request array.</p> <p>The response <code>Records</code> array includes both successfully and unsuccessfully processed records. Kinesis Data Streams attempts to process all records in each <code>PutRecords</code> request. A single record failure does not stop the processing of subsequent records. As a result, PutRecords doesn't guarantee the ordering of records. If you need to read records in the same order they are written to the stream, use <a>PutRecord</a> instead of <code>PutRecords</code>, and write to the same shard.</p> <p>A successfully processed record includes <code>ShardId</code> and <code>SequenceNumber</code> values. The <code>ShardId</code> parameter identifies the shard in the stream where the record is stored. The <code>SequenceNumber</code> parameter is an identifier assigned to the put record, unique to all records in the stream.</p> <p>An unsuccessfully processed record includes <code>ErrorCode</code> and <code>ErrorMessage</code> values. <code>ErrorCode</code> reflects the type of error and can be one of the following values: <code>ProvisionedThroughputExceededException</code> or <code>InternalFailure</code>. <code>ErrorMessage</code> provides more detailed information about the <code>ProvisionedThroughputExceededException</code> exception including the account ID, stream name, and shard ID of the record that was throttled. For more information about partially successful responses, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/kinesis-using-sdk-java-add-data-to-stream.html#kinesis-using-sdk-java-putrecords\">Adding Multiple Records with PutRecords</a> in the <i>Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide</i>.</p> <important> <p>After you write a record to a stream, you cannot modify that record or its order within the stream.</p> </important> <p>By default, data records are accessible for 24 hours from the time that they are added to a stream. You can use <a>IncreaseStreamRetentionPeriod</a> or <a>DecreaseStreamRetentionPeriod</a> to modify this retention period.</p>","Kinesis.RegisterStreamConsumer":"<p>Registers a consumer with a Kinesis data stream. When you use this operation, the consumer you register can then call <a>SubscribeToShard</a> to receive data from the stream using enhanced fan-out, at a rate of up to 2 MiB per second for every shard you subscribe to. This rate is unaffected by the total number of consumers that read from the same stream.</p> <p>You can register up to 20 consumers per stream. A given consumer can only be registered with one stream at a time.</p> <p>For an example of how to use this operations, see <a href=\"/streams/latest/dev/building-enhanced-consumers-api.html\">Enhanced Fan-Out Using the Kinesis Data Streams API</a>.</p> <p>The use of this operation has a limit of five transactions per second per account. Also, only 5 consumers can be created simultaneously. In other words, you cannot have more than 5 consumers in a <code>CREATING</code> status at the same time. Registering a 6th consumer while there are 5 in a <code>CREATING</code> status results in a <code>LimitExceededException</code>.</p>","Kinesis.RemoveTagsFromStream":"<p>Removes tags from the specified Kinesis data stream. Removed tags are deleted and cannot be recovered after this operation successfully completes.</p> <p>If you specify a tag that does not exist, it is ignored.</p> <p> <a>RemoveTagsFromStream</a> has a limit of five transactions per second per account.</p>","Kinesis.SplitShard":"<p>Splits a shard into two new shards in the Kinesis data stream, to increase the stream's capacity to ingest and transport data. <code>SplitShard</code> is called when there is a need to increase the overall capacity of a stream because of an expected increase in the volume of data records being ingested. </p> <p>You can also use <code>SplitShard</code> when a shard appears to be approaching its maximum utilization; for example, the producers sending data into the specific shard are suddenly sending more than previously anticipated. You can also call <code>SplitShard</code> to increase stream capacity, so that more Kinesis Data Streams applications can simultaneously read data from the stream for real-time processing. </p> <p>You must specify the shard to be split and the new hash key, which is the position in the shard where the shard gets split in two. In many cases, the new hash key might be the average of the beginning and ending hash key, but it can be any hash key value in the range being mapped into the shard. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/kinesis-using-sdk-java-resharding-split.html\">Split a Shard</a> in the <i>Amazon Kinesis Data Streams Developer Guide</i>.</p> <p>You can use <a>DescribeStream</a> to determine the shard ID and hash key values for the <code>ShardToSplit</code> and <code>NewStartingHashKey</code> parameters that are specified in the <code>SplitShard</code> request.</p> <p> <code>SplitShard</code> is an asynchronous operation. Upon receiving a <code>SplitShard</code> request, Kinesis Data Streams immediately returns a response and sets the stream status to <code>UPDATING</code>. After the operation is completed, Kinesis Data Streams sets the stream status to <code>ACTIVE</code>.

Upon receiving the request, Kinesis Data Streams returns immediately and sets the status of the stream to <code>UPDATING</code>. After the update is complete, Kinesis Data Streams sets the status of the stream back to <code>ACTIVE</code>. Updating or applying encryption normally takes a few seconds to complete, but it can take minutes. You can continue to read and write data to your stream while its status is <code>UPDATING</code>. Once the status of the stream is <code>ACTIVE</code>, encryption begins for records written to the stream. </p> <p>API Limits: You can successfully apply a new AWS KMS key for server-side encryption 25 times in a rolling 24-hour period.</p> <p>Note: It can take up to 5 seconds after the stream is in an <code>ACTIVE</code> status before all records written to the stream are encrypted. After you enable encryption, you can verify that encryption is applied by inspecting the API response from <code>PutRecord</code> or <code>PutRecords</code>.</p>","Kinesis.StopStreamEncryption":"<p>Disables server-side encryption for a specified stream. </p> <p>Stopping encryption is an asynchronous operation. Upon receiving the request, Kinesis Data Streams returns immediately and sets the status of the stream to <code>UPDATING</code>. After the update is complete, Kinesis Data Streams sets the status of the stream back to <code>ACTIVE</code>. Stopping encryption normally takes a few seconds to complete, but it can take minutes. You can continue to read and write data to your stream while its status is <code>UPDATING</code>. Once the status of the stream is <code>ACTIVE</code>, records written to the stream are no longer encrypted by Kinesis Data Streams. </p> <p>API Limits: You can successfully disable server-side encryption 25 times in a rolling 24-hour period. </p> <p>Note: It can take up to 5 seconds after the stream is in an <code>ACTIVE</code> status before all records written to the stream are no longer subject to encryption.

Upon receiving the request, Kinesis Data Streams returns immediately and sets the status of the stream to <code>UPDATING</code>. After the update is complete, Kinesis Data Streams sets the status of the stream back to <code>ACTIVE</code>. Depending on the size of the stream, the scaling action could take a few minutes to complete. You can continue to read and write data to your stream while its status is <code>UPDATING</code>.</p> <p>To update the shard count, Kinesis Data Streams performs splits or merges on individual shards.

However, it cannot decrypt ciphertext produced by other libraries, such as the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/encryption-sdk/latest/developer-guide/\">AWS Encryption SDK</a> or <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingClientSideEncryption.html\">Amazon S3 client-side encryption</a>. These libraries return a ciphertext format that is incompatible with AWS KMS.</p> <p>If the ciphertext was encrypted under a symmetric CMK, the <code>KeyId</code> parameter is optional. AWS KMS can get this information from metadata that it adds to the symmetric ciphertext blob. This feature adds durability to your implementation by ensuring that authorized users can decrypt ciphertext decades after it was encrypted, even if they've lost track of the CMK ID. However, specifying the CMK is always recommended as a best practice. When you use the <code>KeyId</code> parameter to specify a CMK, AWS KMS only uses the CMK you specify. If the ciphertext was encrypted under a different CMK, the <code>Decrypt</code> operation fails. This practice ensures that you use the CMK that you intend.</p> <p>Whenever possible, use key policies to give users permission to call the <code>Decrypt</code> operation on a particular CMK, instead of using IAM policies. Otherwise, you might create an IAM user policy that gives the user <code>Decrypt</code> permission on all CMKs. This user could decrypt ciphertext that was encrypted by CMKs in other accounts if the key policy for the cross-account CMK permits it. If you must use an IAM policy for <code>Decrypt</code> permissions, limit the user to particular CMKs or particular trusted accounts.

The deployment package is a .zip file archive or container image that contains your function code. The execution role grants the function permission to use AWS services, such as Amazon CloudWatch Logs for log streaming and AWS X-Ray for request tracing.</p> <p>When you create a function, Lambda provisions an instance of the function and its supporting resources. If your function connects to a VPC, this process can take a minute or so. During this time, you can't invoke or modify the function. The <code>State</code>, <code>StateReason</code>, and <code>StateReasonCode</code> fields in the response from <a>GetFunctionConfiguration</a> indicate when the function is ready to invoke. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/functions-states.html\">Function States</a>.</p> <p>A function has an unpublished version, and can have published versions and aliases. The unpublished version changes when you update your function's code and configuration. A published version is a snapshot of your function code and configuration that can't be changed. An alias is a named resource that maps to a version, and can be changed to map to a different version. Use the <code>Publish</code> parameter to create version <code>1</code> of your function from its initial configuration.</p> <p>The other parameters let you configure version-specific and function-level settings. You can modify version-specific settings later with <a>UpdateFunctionConfiguration</a>. Function-level settings apply to both the unpublished and published versions of the function, and include tags (<a>TagResource</a>) and per-function concurrency limits (<a>PutFunctionConcurrency</a>).</p> <p>You can use code signing if your deployment package is a .zip file archive. To enable code signing for this function, specify the ARN of a code-signing configuration. When a user attempts to deploy a code package with <a>UpdateFunctionCode</a>, Lambda checks that the code package has a valid signature from a trusted publisher. The code-signing configuration includes set set of signing profiles, which define the trusted publishers for this function.</p> <p>If another account or an AWS service invokes your function, use <a>AddPermission</a> to grant permission by creating a resource-based IAM policy. You can grant permissions at the function level, on a version, or on an alias.</p> <p>To invoke your function directly, use <a>Invoke</a>.

Retry behavior varies by error type, client, event source, and invocation type. For example, if you invoke a function asynchronously and it returns an error, Lambda executes the function up to two more times. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/retries-on-errors.html\">Retry Behavior</a>.</p> <p>For <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/invocation-async.html\">asynchronous invocation</a>, Lambda adds events to a queue before sending them to your function. If your function does not have enough capacity to keep up with the queue, events may be lost. Occasionally, your function may receive the same event multiple times, even if no error occurs.

You can use snapshots for backups, to make copies of disks, and to save data before shutting down a Lightsail instance.</p> <p>You can take a snapshot of an attached disk that is in use; however, snapshots only capture data that has been written to your disk at the time the snapshot command is issued. This may exclude any data that has been cached by any applications or the operating system. If you can pause any file systems on the disk long enough to take a snapshot, your snapshot should be complete. Nevertheless, if you cannot pause all file writes to the disk, you should unmount the disk from within the Lightsail instance, issue the create disk snapshot command, and then remount the disk to ensure a consistent and complete snapshot. You may remount and use your disk while the snapshot status is pending.</p> <p>You can also use this operation to create a snapshot of an instance's system volume. You might want to do this, for example, to recover data from the system volume of a botched instance or to create a backup of the system volume like you would for a block storage disk. To create a snapshot of a system volume, just define the <code>instance name</code> parameter when issuing the snapshot command, and a snapshot of the defined instance's system volume will be created. After the snapshot is available, you can create a block storage disk from the snapshot and attach it to a running instance to access the data on the disk.</p> <p>The <code>create disk snapshot</code> operation supports tag-based access control via request tags.

Free and BYOL products for Amazon ECS or Amazon EKS aren't required to call RegisterUsage, but you may choose to do so if you would like to receive usage data in your seller reports. The sections below explain the behavior of RegisterUsage. RegisterUsage performs two primary functions: metering and entitlement.</p> <ul> <li> <p> <i>Entitlement</i>: RegisterUsage allows you to verify that the customer running your paid software is subscribed to your product on AWS Marketplace, enabling you to guard against unauthorized use. Your container image that integrates with RegisterUsage is only required to guard against unauthorized use at container startup, as such a CustomerNotSubscribedException/PlatformNotSupportedException will only be thrown on the initial call to RegisterUsage. Subsequent calls from the same Amazon ECS task instance (e.g. task-id) or Amazon EKS pod will not throw a CustomerNotSubscribedException, even if the customer unsubscribes while the Amazon ECS task or Amazon EKS pod is still running.</p> </li> <li> <p> <i>Metering</i>: RegisterUsage meters software use per ECS task, per hour, or per pod for Amazon EKS with usage prorated to the second. A minimum of 1 minute of usage applies to tasks that are short lived. For example, if a customer has a 10 node Amazon ECS or Amazon EKS cluster and a service configured as a Daemon Set, then Amazon ECS or Amazon EKS will launch a task on all 10 cluster nodes and the customer will be charged: (10 * hourly_rate). Metering for software use is automatically handled by the AWS Marketplace Metering Control Plane -- your software is not required to perform any metering specific actions, other than call RegisterUsage once for metering of software use to commence. The AWS Marketplace Metering Control Plane will also continue to bill customers for running ECS tasks and Amazon EKS pods, regardless of the customers subscription state, removing the need for your software to perform entitlement checks at runtime.</p> </li> </ul>","MarketplaceMetering.ResolveCustomer":"<p>ResolveCustomer is called by a SaaS application during the registration process.

This operation disassociates the HIT from its old HITType properties and associates it with the new HITType properties. The HIT takes on the properties of the new HITType in place of the old ones. </p>","MTurk.UpdateNotificationSettings":"<p> The <code>UpdateNotificationSettings</code> operation creates, updates, disables or re-enables notifications for a HIT type. If you call the UpdateNotificationSettings operation for a HIT type that already has a notification specification, the operation replaces the old specification with a new one. You can call the UpdateNotificationSettings operation to enable or disable notifications for the HIT type, without having to modify the notification specification itself by providing updates to the Active status without specifying a new notification specification. To change the Active status of a HIT type's notifications, the HIT type must already have a notification specification, or one must be provided in the same call to <code>UpdateNotificationSettings</code>. </p>","MTurk.UpdateQualificationType":"<p> The <code>UpdateQualificationType</code> operation modifies the attributes of an existing Qualification type, which is represented by a QualificationType data structure. Only the owner of a Qualification type can modify its attributes. </p> <p> Most attributes of a Qualification type can be changed after the type has been created. However, the Name and Keywords fields cannot be modified. The RetryDelayInSeconds parameter can be modified or added to change the delay or to enable retries, but RetryDelayInSeconds cannot be used to disable retries. </p> <p> You can use this operation to update the test for a Qualification type. The test is updated based on the values specified for the Test, TestDurationInSeconds and AnswerKey parameters. All three parameters specify the updated test. If you are updating the test for a type, you must specify the Test and TestDurationInSeconds parameters. The AnswerKey parameter is optional; omitting it specifies that the updated test does not have an answer key. </p> <p> If you omit the Test parameter, the test for the Qualification type is unchanged. There is no way to remove a test from a Qualification type that has one. If the type already has a test, you cannot update it to be AutoGranted. If the Qualification type does not have a test and one is provided by an update, the type will henceforth have a test. </p> <p> If you want to update the test duration or answer key for an existing test without changing the questions, you must specify a Test parameter with the original questions, along with the updated values. </p> <p> If you provide an updated Test but no AnswerKey, the new test will not have an answer key.

A false negative is an incorrect prediction that a face in the target image has a low similarity confidence score when compared to the face in the source image. To reduce the probability of false negatives, we recommend that you compare the target image against multiple source images. If you plan to use <code>CompareFaces</code> to make a decision that impacts an individual's rights, privacy, or access to services, we recommend that you pass the result to a human for review and further validation before taking action.</p> </note> <p>You pass the input and target images either as base64-encoded image bytes or as references to images in an Amazon S3 bucket.

The request body contains a list of change items, known as a change batch. Change batches are considered transactional changes. Route 53 validates the changes in the request and then either makes all or none of the changes in the change batch request. This ensures that DNS routing isn't adversely affected by partial changes to the resource record sets in a hosted zone. </p> <p>For example, suppose a change batch request contains two changes: it deletes the <code>CNAME</code> resource record set for www.example.com and creates an alias resource record set for www.example.com. If validation for both records succeeds, Route 53 deletes the first resource record set and creates the second resource record set in a single operation. If validation for either the <code>DELETE</code> or the <code>CREATE</code> action fails, then the request is canceled, and the original <code>CNAME</code> record continues to exist.</p> <note> <p>If you try to delete the same resource record set more than once in a single change batch, Route 53 returns an <code>InvalidChangeBatch</code> error.</p> </note> <p> <b>Traffic Flow</b> </p> <p>To create resource record sets for complex routing configurations, use either the traffic flow visual editor in the Route 53 console or the API actions for traffic policies and traffic policy instances.

To copy a different version, use the <code>versionId</code> subresource.</p> <p>If you enable versioning on the target bucket, Amazon S3 generates a unique version ID for the object being copied. This version ID is different from the version ID of the source object. Amazon S3 returns the version ID of the copied object in the <code>x-amz-version-id</code> response header in the response.</p> <p>If you do not enable versioning or suspend it on the target bucket, the version ID that Amazon S3 generates is always null.</p> <p>If the source object's storage class is GLACIER, you must restore a copy of this object before you can use it as a source object for the copy operation.

For more information about permissions, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-with-s3-actions.html#using-with-s3-actions-related-to-bucket-subresources\">Permissions Related to Bucket Subresource Operations</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-access-control.html\">Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3 Resources</a>.</p> <p> The Transfer Acceleration state of a bucket can be set to one of the following two values:</p> <ul> <li> <p> Enabled – Enables accelerated data transfers to the bucket.</p> </li> <li> <p> Suspended – Disables accelerated data transfers to the bucket.</p> </li> </ul> <p>The <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetBucketAccelerateConfiguration.html\">GetBucketAccelerateConfiguration</a> action returns the transfer acceleration state of a bucket.</p> <p>After setting the Transfer Acceleration state of a bucket to Enabled, it might take up to thirty minutes before the data transfer rates to the bucket increase.</p> <p> The name of the bucket used for Transfer Acceleration must be DNS-compliant and must not contain periods (\".\").</p> <p> For more information about transfer acceleration, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/transfer-acceleration.html\">Transfer Acceleration</a>.</p> <p>The following operations are related to <code>PutBucketAccelerateConfiguration</code>:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetBucketAccelerateConfiguration.html\">GetBucketAccelerateConfiguration</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateBucket.html\">CreateBucket</a> </p> </li> </ul>","S3.PutBucketAcl":"<p>Sets the permissions on an existing bucket using access control lists (ACL). For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/S3_ACLs_UsingACLs.html\">Using ACLs</a>. To set the ACL of a bucket, you must have <code>WRITE_ACP</code> permission.</p> <p>You can use one of the following two ways to set a bucket's permissions:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Specify the ACL in the request body</p> </li> <li> <p>Specify permissions using request headers</p> </li> </ul> <note> <p>You cannot specify access permission using both the body and the request headers.</p> </note> <p>Depending on your application needs, you may choose to set the ACL on a bucket using either the request body or the headers.

Amazon S3 supports a set of predefined ACLs, known as <i>canned ACLs</i>. Each canned ACL has a predefined set of grantees and permissions. Specify the canned ACL name as the value of <code>x-amz-acl</code>. If you use this header, you cannot use other access control-specific headers in your request. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#CannedACL\">Canned ACL</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Specify access permissions explicitly with the <code>x-amz-grant-read</code>, <code>x-amz-grant-read-acp</code>, <code>x-amz-grant-write-acp</code>, and <code>x-amz-grant-full-control</code> headers. When using these headers, you specify explicit access permissions and grantees (AWS accounts or Amazon S3 groups) who will receive the permission. If you use these ACL-specific headers, you cannot use the <code>x-amz-acl</code> header to set a canned ACL. These parameters map to the set of permissions that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html\">Access Control List (ACL) Overview</a>.</p> <p>You specify each grantee as a type=value pair, where the type is one of the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>id</code> – if the value specified is the canonical user ID of an AWS account</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>uri</code> – if you are granting permissions to a predefined group</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>emailAddress</code> – if the value specified is the email address of an AWS account</p> <note> <p>Using email addresses to specify a grantee is only supported in the following AWS Regions: </p> <ul> <li> <p>US East (N.

By default, the bucket owner has this permission and can grant it to others.</p> <p>You set this configuration on a bucket so that the bucket can service cross-origin requests. For example, you might want to enable a request whose origin is <code>http://www.example.com</code> to access your Amazon S3 bucket at <code>my.example.bucket.com</code> by using the browser's <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> capability.</p> <p>To enable cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) on a bucket, you add the <code>cors</code> subresource to the bucket. The <code>cors</code> subresource is an XML document in which you configure rules that identify origins and the HTTP methods that can be executed on your bucket. The document is limited to 64 KB in size. </p> <p>When Amazon S3 receives a cross-origin request (or a pre-flight OPTIONS request) against a bucket, it evaluates the <code>cors</code> configuration on the bucket and uses the first <code>CORSRule</code> rule that matches the incoming browser request to enable a cross-origin request. For a rule to match, the following conditions must be met:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The request's <code>Origin</code> header must match <code>AllowedOrigin</code> elements.</p> </li> <li> <p>The request method (for example, GET, PUT, HEAD, and so on) or the <code>Access-Control-Request-Method</code> header in case of a pre-flight <code>OPTIONS</code> request must be one of the <code>AllowedMethod</code> elements. </p> </li> <li> <p>Every header specified in the <code>Access-Control-Request-Headers</code> request header of a pre-flight request must match an <code>AllowedHeader</code> element. </p> </li> </ul> <p> For more information about CORS, go to <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/cors.html\">Enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 User Guide</i>.</p> <p class=\"title\"> <b>Related Resources</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p> <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetBucketCors.html\">GetBucketCors</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_DeleteBucketCors.html\">DeleteBucketCors</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTOPTIONSobject.html\">RESTOPTIONSobject</a> </p> </li> </ul>","S3.PutBucketEncryption":"<p>This action uses the <code>encryption</code> subresource to configure default encryption and Amazon S3 Bucket Key for an existing bucket.</p> <p>Default encryption for a bucket can use server-side encryption with Amazon S3-managed keys (SSE-S3) or AWS KMS customer master keys (SSE-KMS).

For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html\">Access Control List (ACL) Overview</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 User Guide</i>.</p> <p> <b>Access Permissions</b> </p> <p>You can set access permissions using one of the following methods:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Specify a canned ACL with the <code>x-amz-acl</code> request header. Amazon S3 supports a set of predefined ACLs, known as canned ACLs. Each canned ACL has a predefined set of grantees and permissions. Specify the canned ACL name as the value of <code>x-amz-ac</code>l. If you use this header, you cannot use other access control-specific headers in your request. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html#CannedACL\">Canned ACL</a>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Specify access permissions explicitly with the <code>x-amz-grant-read</code>, <code>x-amz-grant-read-acp</code>, <code>x-amz-grant-write-acp</code>, and <code>x-amz-grant-full-control</code> headers. When using these headers, you specify explicit access permissions and grantees (AWS accounts or Amazon S3 groups) who will receive the permission. If you use these ACL-specific headers, you cannot use <code>x-amz-acl</code> header to set a canned ACL. These parameters map to the set of permissions that Amazon S3 supports in an ACL. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/acl-overview.html\">Access Control List (ACL) Overview</a>.</p> <p>You specify each grantee as a type=value pair, where the type is one of the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>id</code> – if the value specified is the canonical user ID of an AWS account</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>uri</code> – if you are granting permissions to a predefined group</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>emailAddress</code> – if the value specified is the email address of an AWS account</p> <note> <p>Using email addresses to specify a grantee is only supported in the following AWS Regions: </p> <ul> <li> <p>US East (N.

For objects in Archive Access or Deep Archive Access tiers you must first initiate a restore request, and then wait until the object is moved into the Frequent Access tier. For objects in S3 Glacier or S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage classes you must first initiate a restore request, and then wait until a temporary copy of the object is available. To access an archived object, you must restore the object for the duration (number of days) that you specify.</p> <p>To restore a specific object version, you can provide a version ID. If you don't provide a version ID, Amazon S3 restores the current version.</p> <p>When restoring an archived object (or using a select request), you can specify one of the following data access tier options in the <code>Tier</code> element of the request body: </p> <ul> <li> <p> <b> <code>Expedited</code> </b> - Expedited retrievals allow you to quickly access your data stored in the S3 Glacier storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive tier when occasional urgent requests for a subset of archives are required. For all but the largest archived objects (250 MB+), data accessed using Expedited retrievals is typically made available within 1–5 minutes. Provisioned capacity ensures that retrieval capacity for Expedited retrievals is available when you need it. Expedited retrievals and provisioned capacity are not available for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tier.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b> <code>Standard</code> </b> - Standard retrievals allow you to access any of your archived objects within several hours. This is the default option for retrieval requests that do not specify the retrieval option. Standard retrievals typically finish within 3–5 hours for objects stored in the S3 Glacier storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive tier. They typically finish within 12 hours for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tier. Standard retrievals are free for objects stored in S3 Intelligent-Tiering.</p> </li> <li> <p> <b> <code>Bulk</code> </b> - Bulk retrievals are the lowest-cost retrieval option in S3 Glacier, enabling you to retrieve large amounts, even petabytes, of data inexpensively. Bulk retrievals typically finish within 5–12 hours for objects stored in the S3 Glacier storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Archive tier. They typically finish within 48 hours for objects stored in the S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage class or S3 Intelligent-Tiering Deep Archive tier. Bulk retrievals are free for objects stored in S3 Intelligent-Tiering.</p> </li> </ul> <p>For more information about archive retrieval options and provisioned capacity for <code>Expedited</code> data access, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/restoring-objects.html\">Restoring Archived Objects</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 User Guide</i>. </p> <p>You can use Amazon S3 restore speed upgrade to change the restore speed to a faster speed while it is in progress. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/restoring-objects.html#restoring-objects-upgrade-tier.title.html\"> Upgrading the speed of an in-progress restore</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 User Guide</i>. </p> <p>To get the status of object restoration, you can send a <code>HEAD</code> request. Operations return the <code>x-amz-restore</code> header, which provides information about the restoration status, in the response. You can use Amazon S3 event notifications to notify you when a restore is initiated or completed. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/NotificationHowTo.html\">Configuring Amazon S3 Event Notifications</a> in the <i>Amazon S3 User Guide</i>.</p> <p>After restoring an archived object, you can update the restoration period by reissuing the request with a new period. Amazon S3 updates the restoration period relative to the current time and charges only for the request-there are no data transfer charges. You cannot update the restoration period when Amazon S3 is actively processing your current restore request for the object.</p> <p>If your bucket has a lifecycle configuration with a rule that includes an expiration action, the object expiration overrides the life span that you specify in a restore request. For example, if you restore an object copy for 10 days, but the object is scheduled to expire in 3 days, Amazon S3 deletes the object in 3 days.

For example, if an item has the attributes <code>{ 'a', '1' }</code>, <code>{ 'b', '2'}</code> and <code>{ 'b', '3' }</code> and the requestor calls <code>PutAttributes</code> using the attributes <code>{ 'b', '4' }</code> with the <code>Replace</code> parameter set to true, the final attributes of the item are changed to <code>{ 'a', '1' }</code> and <code>{ 'b', '4' }</code>, which replaces the previous values of the 'b' attribute with the new value. </p> <note> Using <code>PutAttributes</code> to replace attribute values that do not exist will not result in an error response. </note> <p> You cannot specify an empty string as an attribute name. </p> <p> Because Amazon SimpleDB makes multiple copies of client data and uses an eventual consistency update model, an immediate <a>GetAttributes</a> or <a>Select</a> operation (read) immediately after a <a>PutAttributes</a> or <a>DeleteAttributes</a> operation (write) might not return the updated data. </p> <p> The following limitations are enforced for this operation: <ul> <li>256 total attribute name-value pairs per item</li> <li>One billion attributes per domain</li> <li>10 GB of total user data storage per domain</li> </ul> </p>","SimpleDB.Select":"<p> The <code>Select</code> operation returns a set of attributes for <code>ItemNames</code> that match the select expression. <code>Select</code> is similar to the standard SQL SELECT statement. </p> <p> The total size of the response cannot exceed 1 MB in total size. Amazon SimpleDB automatically adjusts the number of items returned per page to enforce this limit. For example, if the client asks to retrieve 2500 items, but each individual item is 10 kB in size, the system returns 100 items and an appropriate <code>NextToken</code> so the client can access the next page of results. </p> <p> For information on how to construct select expressions, see Using Select to Create Amazon SimpleDB Queries in the Developer Guide. </p>","SMS.CreateApp":"<p>Creates an application.

The default visibility timeout for a message is 30 seconds. The minimum is 0 seconds. The maximum is 12 hours. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-visibility-timeout.html\">Visibility Timeout</a> in the <i>Amazon Simple Queue Service Developer Guide</i>.</p> <p>For example, you have a message with a visibility timeout of 5 minutes. After 3 minutes, you call <code>ChangeMessageVisibility</code> with a timeout of 10 minutes. You can continue to call <code>ChangeMessageVisibility</code> to extend the visibility timeout to the maximum allowed time. If you try to extend the visibility timeout beyond the maximum, your request is rejected.</p> <p>An Amazon SQS message has three basic states:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Sent to a queue by a producer.</p> </li> <li> <p>Received from the queue by a consumer.</p> </li> <li> <p>Deleted from the queue.</p> </li> </ol> <p>A message is considered to be <i>stored</i> after it is sent to a queue by a producer, but not yet received from the queue by a consumer (that is, between states 1 and 2). There is no limit to the number of stored messages. A message is considered to be <i>in flight</i> after it is received from a queue by a consumer, but not yet deleted from the queue (that is, between states 2 and 3). There is a limit to the number of inflight messages.</p> <p>Limits that apply to inflight messages are unrelated to the <i>unlimited</i> number of stored messages.</p> <p>For most standard queues (depending on queue traffic and message backlog), there can be a maximum of approximately 120,000 inflight messages (received from a queue by a consumer, but not yet deleted from the queue). If you reach this limit, Amazon SQS returns the <code>OverLimit</code> error message. To avoid reaching the limit, you should delete messages from the queue after they're processed. You can also increase the number of queues you use to process your messages. To request a limit increase, <a href=\"https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/case/create?issueType=service-limit-increase&amp;limitType=service-code-sqs\">file a support request</a>.</p> <p>For FIFO queues, there can be a maximum of 20,000 inflight messages (received from a queue by a consumer, but not yet deleted from the queue). If you reach this limit, Amazon SQS returns no error messages.</p> <important> <p>If you attempt to set the <code>VisibilityTimeout</code> to a value greater than the maximum time left, Amazon SQS returns an error. Amazon SQS doesn't automatically recalculate and increase the timeout to the maximum remaining time.</p> <p>Unlike with a queue, when you change the visibility timeout for a specific message the timeout value is applied immediately but isn't saved in memory for that message. If you don't delete a message after it is received, the visibility timeout for the message reverts to the original timeout value (not to the value you set using the <code>ChangeMessageVisibility</code> action) the next time the message is received.</p> </important>","SQS.ChangeMessageVisibilityBatch":"<p>Changes the visibility timeout of multiple messages. This is a batch version of <code> <a>ChangeMessageVisibility</a>.</code> The result of the action on each message is reported individually in the response. You can send up to 10 <code> <a>ChangeMessageVisibility</a> </code> requests with each <code>ChangeMessageVisibilityBatch</code> action.</p> <important> <p>Because the batch request can result in a combination of successful and unsuccessful actions, you should check for batch errors even when the call returns an HTTP status code of <code>200</code>.</p> </important> <p>Some actions take lists of parameters. These lists are specified using the <code>param.n</code> notation. Values of <code>n</code> are integers starting from 1. For example, a parameter list with two elements looks like this:</p> <p> <code>&amp;AttributeName.1=first</code> </p> <p> <code>&amp;AttributeName.2=second</code> </p>","SQS.CreateQueue":"<p>Creates a new standard or FIFO queue. You can pass one or more attributes in the request. Keep the following in mind:</p> <ul> <li> <p>If you don't specify the <code>FifoQueue</code> attribute, Amazon SQS creates a standard queue.</p> <note> <p>You can't change the queue type after you create it and you can't convert an existing standard queue into a FIFO queue. You must either create a new FIFO queue for your application or delete your existing standard queue and recreate it as a FIFO queue.

To select the message to delete, use the <code>ReceiptHandle</code> of the message (<i>not</i> the <code>MessageId</code> which you receive when you send the message). Amazon SQS can delete a message from a queue even if a visibility timeout setting causes the message to be locked by another consumer. Amazon SQS automatically deletes messages left in a queue longer than the retention period configured for the queue. </p> <note> <p>The <code>ReceiptHandle</code> is associated with a <i>specific instance</i> of receiving a message. If you receive a message more than once, the <code>ReceiptHandle</code> is different each time you receive a message. When you use the <code>DeleteMessage</code> action, you must provide the most recently received <code>ReceiptHandle</code> for the message (otherwise, the request succeeds, but the message might not be deleted).</p> <p>For standard queues, it is possible to receive a message even after you delete it. This might happen on rare occasions if one of the servers which stores a copy of the message is unavailable when you send the request to delete the message. The copy remains on the server and might be returned to you during a subsequent receive request. You should ensure that your application is idempotent, so that receiving a message more than once does not cause issues.</p> </note>","SQS.DeleteMessageBatch":"<p>Deletes up to ten messages from the specified queue. This is a batch version of <code> <a>DeleteMessage</a>.</code> The result of the action on each message is reported individually in the response.</p> <important> <p>Because the batch request can result in a combination of successful and unsuccessful actions, you should check for batch errors even when the call returns an HTTP status code of <code>200</code>.</p> </important> <p>Some actions take lists of parameters.

Tags are metadata that you can assign to your documents, managed instances, maintenance windows, Parameter Store parameters, and patch baselines. Tags enable you to categorize your resources in different ways, for example, by purpose, owner, or environment. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define. For example, you could define a set of tags for your account's managed instances that helps you track each instance's owner and stack level. For example: Key=Owner and Value=DbAdmin, SysAdmin, or Dev. Or Key=Stack and Value=Production, Pre-Production, or Test.</p> <p>Each resource can have a maximum of 50 tags. </p> <p>We recommend that you devise a set of tag keys that meets your needs for each resource type.

For example, an association can specify that anti-virus software must be installed and running on your instances, or that certain ports must be closed. For static targets, the association specifies a schedule for when the configuration is reapplied. For dynamic targets, such as an AWS Resource Group or an AWS Autoscaling Group, State Manager applies the configuration when new instances are added to the group. The association also specifies actions to take when applying the configuration. For example, an association for anti-virus software might run once a day. If the software is not installed, then State Manager installs it. If the software is installed, but the service is not running, then the association might instruct State Manager to start the service. </p>","SSM.CreateAssociationBatch":"<p>Associates the specified Systems Manager document with the specified instances or targets.</p> <p>When you associate a document with one or more instances using instance IDs or tags, SSM Agent running on the instance processes the document and configures the instance as specified.</p> <p>If you associate a document with an instance that already has an associated document, the system returns the AssociationAlreadyExists exception.</p>","SSM.CreateDocument":"<p>Creates a Systems Manager (SSM) document.

The <code>RateBasedRule</code> contains a <code>RateLimit</code>, which specifies the maximum number of requests that AWS WAF allows from a specified IP address in a five-minute period. The <code>RateBasedRule</code> also contains the <code>IPSet</code> objects, <code>ByteMatchSet</code> objects, and other predicates that identify the requests that you want to count or block if these requests exceed the <code>RateLimit</code>.</p> <p>If you add more than one predicate to a <code>RateBasedRule</code>, a request not only must exceed the <code>RateLimit</code>, but it also must match all the conditions to be counted or blocked.

Further, requests that match these two conditions must be received at a rate of more than 1,000 requests every five minutes.

If the rate drops below 1,000 for a five-minute period, AWS WAF no longer blocks the requests.</p> <p>As a second example, suppose you want to limit requests to a particular page on your site.

However, when you <i>delete</i> an accelerator, you lose the static IP addresses that are assigned to the accelerator, so you can no longer route traffic by using them. As a best practice, ensure that you have permissions in place to avoid inadvertently deleting accelerators. You can use IAM policies with Global Accelerator to limit the users who have permissions to delete an accelerator.

Rules are enabled by default, or based on value of the state. You can disable a rule using <a>DisableRule</a>.</p> <p>A single rule watches for events from a single event bus. Events generated by AWS services go to your account's default event bus. Events generated by SaaS partner services or applications go to the matching partner event bus. If you have custom applications or services, you can specify whether their events go to your default event bus or a custom event bus that you have created. For more information, see <a>CreateEventBus</a>.</p> <p>If you are updating an existing rule, the rule is replaced with what you specify in this <code>PutRule</code> command. If you omit arguments in <code>PutRule</code>, the old values for those arguments are not kept. Instead, they are replaced with null values.</p> <p>When you create or update a rule, incoming events might not immediately start matching to new or updated rules. Allow a short period of time for changes to take effect.</p> <p>A rule must contain at least an EventPattern or ScheduleExpression. Rules with EventPatterns are triggered when a matching event is observed. Rules with ScheduleExpressions self-trigger based on the given schedule. A rule can have both an EventPattern and a ScheduleExpression, in which case the rule triggers on matching events as well as on a schedule.</p> <p>When you initially create a rule, you can optionally assign one or more tags to the rule. Tags can help you organize and categorize your resources. You can also use them to scope user permissions, by granting a user permission to access or change only rules with certain tag values. To use the <code>PutRule</code> operation and assign tags, you must have both the <code>events:PutRule</code> and <code>events:TagResource</code> permissions.</p> <p>If you are updating an existing rule, any tags you specify in the <code>PutRule</code> operation are ignored. To update the tags of an existing rule, use <a>TagResource</a> and <a>UntagResource</a>.</p> <p>Most services in AWS treat : or / as the same character in Amazon Resource Names (ARNs). However, EventBridge uses an exact match in event patterns and rules. Be sure to use the correct ARN characters when creating event patterns so that they match the ARN syntax in the event you want to match.</p> <p>In EventBridge, it is possible to create rules that lead to infinite loops, where a rule is fired repeatedly. For example, a rule might detect that ACLs have changed on an S3 bucket, and trigger software to change them to the desired state. If the rule is not written carefully, the subsequent change to the ACLs fires the rule again, creating an infinite loop.</p> <p>To prevent this, write the rules so that the triggered actions do not re-fire the same rule. For example, your rule could fire only if ACLs are found to be in a bad state, instead of after any change. </p> <p>An infinite loop can quickly cause higher than expected charges. We recommend that you use budgeting, which alerts you when charges exceed your specified limit.

If the target is a Kinesis data stream, you can optionally specify which shard the event goes to by using the <code>KinesisParameters</code> argument. To invoke a command on multiple EC2 instances with one rule, you can use the <code>RunCommandParameters</code> field.</p> <p>To be able to make API calls against the resources that you own, Amazon EventBridge (CloudWatch Events) needs the appropriate permissions. For AWS Lambda and Amazon SNS resources, EventBridge relies on resource-based policies. For EC2 instances, Kinesis data streams, AWS Step Functions state machines and API Gateway REST APIs, EventBridge relies on IAM roles that you specify in the <code>RoleARN</code> argument in <code>PutTargets</code>.

Set that account's event bus as a target of the rules in your account. To send the matched events to the other account, specify that account's event bus as the <code>Arn</code> value when you run <code>PutTargets</code>. If your account sends events to another account, your account is charged for each sent event. Each event sent to another account is charged as a custom event.

Predictive inbox placement tests can help you predict how your messages will be handled by various email providers around the world. When you perform a predictive inbox placement test, you provide a sample message that contains the content that you plan to send to your customers.

An <i>identity</i> is an email address or domain that you use when you send email. Before you can use an identity to send email, you first have to verify it. By verifying an identity, you demonstrate that you're the owner of the identity, and that you've given Amazon SES API v2 permission to send email from the identity.</p> <p>When you verify an email address, Amazon SES sends an email to the address. Your email address is verified as soon as you follow the link in the verification email. </p> <p>When you verify a domain without specifying the <code>DkimSigningAttributes</code> object, this operation provides a set of DKIM tokens. You can convert these tokens into CNAME records, which you then add to the DNS configuration for your domain.

This verification method is known as <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/easy-dkim.html\">Easy DKIM</a>.</p> <p>Alternatively, you can perform the verification process by providing your own public-private key pair. This verification method is known as Bring Your Own DKIM (BYODKIM). To use BYODKIM, your call to the <code>CreateEmailIdentity</code> operation has to include the <code>DkimSigningAttributes</code> object. When you specify this object, you provide a selector (a component of the DNS record name that identifies the public key that you want to use for DKIM authentication) and a private key.</p> <p>When you verify a domain, this operation provides a set of DKIM tokens, which you can convert into CNAME tokens. You add these CNAME tokens to the DNS configuration for your domain. Your domain is verified when Amazon SES detects these records in the DNS configuration for your domain.
